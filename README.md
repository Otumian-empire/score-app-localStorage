# score-app
This is a verify simple cliche of an app the makes use of 
the localStorage API to keep track of the scores in a game
between two players. Each score is a basically an object, 
made of of two proerties/keys, players and scores, whereby 
players and scores are basically arrays

## Example
score_board = [
	{
		players: ['john', 'mike'],
		scores: [2,4]
	},
	{
		players: ['peter', 'derrick'],
		scores: [3, 0]
	}
]
